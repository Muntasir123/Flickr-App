# Flickr-App
An Android Application Replica of Flickr


**Features in this version**

- Uploading capability for users (This is rather slow, needs to be fixed later)
- Connection to a SQL server which stores information in the backend
- Each user has its own distinct profile
- This 'Flickr' is made more like a facebook page, it has distinct home-pages based on your friends

**Some bugs**

- The tree search between friends and related friends isn't too great. (I'm using some variation of merge sort right now), probably should 
subscribe to the quick-sort route.

- Resolution on HUAWEI seems to be a bit glitchy at times. Could be something messed up with how the viewport is laid out.
